## IdealOpAmp

The ideal OpAmp is a two-port device. The left port is fixed to *v1=0* and
*i1=0* (nullator). At the right port, both any voltage *v2* and any
current *i2* are possible (norator).

The ideal OpAmp with three pins is of exactly the same behaviour as the
ideal OpAmp with four pins. Only the negative output pin is left out.
Both the input voltage and current are fixed to zero (nullator). At the
output pin both any voltage *v2* and any current *i2* are possible.
